* What it is
  Stands for Secure SHell, works with assymetric encription, meaning
  there's a public key and a private key pair.
  What you upload to servers (and download from them) is the *public key!*
* Commands
** Copy public key to server
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results raw
   ssh-copy-id <destination_server>
   #+END_SRC
** Transfer files from one server to another
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   scp <source> <destination>
   #+END_SRC
