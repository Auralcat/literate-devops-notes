* SQL
** Create new user
   First create a new login:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sql results :raw
   CREATE LOGIN login_name WITH PASSWORD { password | hashed_password HASHED } [ MUST_CHANGE ]
   [ , SID = sid_value
     | DEFAULT_DATABASE = database_name
     | DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = language_name
     | CHECK_EXPIRATION = { ON | OFF }
     | CHECK_POLICY = { ON | OFF }
     | CREDENTIAL = credential_name ];
   #+END_SRC
   Parameters:
   - login_name: Name of the login
   - database_name: the default database to assign to the login.
   - language_name: the default language to assign to the login.
   - CHECK_EXPIRATION: By default, it's set to OFF. This option
     determines whether password expiration policy is enforced.
   - password: the password assigned to the login.
   - hashed_password: the hashed value of the password to assign to
     the login.
   - MUST_CHANGE: It is used when you want to force the password to be
     changed the first time the login is used.
   - sid_value: the GUID of the login. If this parameter is omitted,
     SQL Server will assign a GUID to the login.
   - credential_name: the name of the credential to assign to the login.
